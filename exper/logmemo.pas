 I have a simple program that uses a TMemo component. When I run the program, the TMemo component is not visible. I can see the form, but the TMemo component is not there. I can click on the area where the TMemo component should be and the cursor will blink as if the TMemo component is there, but I can't see it. I can type text into the TMemo component and it will appear in the TMemo component, but I can't see the TMemo component. I have tried changing the color of the TMemo component, but that doesn't help. I have tried changing the font of the TMemo component, but that doesn't help. I have tried changing the size of the TMemo component, but that doesn't help. I have tried changing the position of the TMemo component, but that doesn't help. I have tried changing the size of the form, but that doesn't help.
